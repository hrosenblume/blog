## Select Investments Section

Add a new section to the homepage called "Select Investments" that showcases companies I've invested in.

**Features:**
- Company logos (consistent sizing, possibly grayscale with color on hover)
- Company name
- Short description of what the company does
- Links to company websites

**Design considerations:**
- Grid layout that works well on mobile and desktop
- Fits the minimal aesthetic of the rest of the site
- Consider a subtle hover effect for interactivity
