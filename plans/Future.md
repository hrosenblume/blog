## Select Investments Section

Add a new section to the homepage called "Select Investments" that showcases companies I've invested in.

**Features:**
- Company logos (consistent sizing, possibly grayscale with color on hover)
- Company name
- Short description of what the company does
- Links to company websites

**Design considerations:**
- Grid layout that works well on mobile and desktop
- Fits the minimal aesthetic of the rest of the site
- Consider a subtle hover effect for interactivity

## Custom Homepage Essay Order

Allow manual control over which essays appear on the homepage and in what order (instead of just showing most recent). Options include a "featured" toggle per essay or full drag-and-drop ordering in admin.

## RSS Feed + Email Subscription

Allow readers to subscribe to new essays:
- **RSS feed** at `/feed.xml` with autodiscovery
- **Email newsletter** via Buttondown or Mailchimp
- Subscribe form on homepage/footer

## Visual Bio Section

Transform the plaintext bio section on the homepage into something more visually engaging.

**Ideas:**
- Animated typewriter effect for key phrases
- Subtle gradient or highlight on important words/links
- Interactive elements (hover effects, micro-animations)
- Background texture or pattern that complements the polyhedra aesthetic
- Photo/avatar with creative treatment (duotone, geometric mask, etc.)
- Timeline or visual representation of career journey
- Pull quotes or highlighted stats that stand out

**Design considerations:**
- Keep the minimal aesthetic — enhance, don't overwhelm
- Ensure accessibility (motion preferences, contrast)
- Mobile-first approach
- Should feel cohesive with the 3D polyhedra and overall site vibe
